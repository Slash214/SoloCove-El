Notes on using vue3-SoloCove-Element-UI:
1. The project uses lf line breaks instead of crlf line breaks by default. Please pay attention to the file line break when creating a new file
2. The project uses the most extensive MIT open source agreement. Keeping the MIT open source agreement can be used for free commercial purposes
3. The personal development project is still under maintenance and development. Feedback is welcome
4. There are no excessive components or other encapsulations. It is just a basic framework, which is very convenient for secondary modification. At the same time, the color is also configured by me at will, and it is also very convenient to change.
5. The icon used is the Element-plus icon

```

Precautions for using vue-JaneJane-admin:
1. lf newline character is used by default in the project instead of crlf newline character. Please select file newline character when creating a file
2. The project uses the MIT open source protocol with the broadest requirements, and the MIT open source protocol can be retained for free commercial use
3. The personal development project is still under maintenance and development. Feedback is welcome
